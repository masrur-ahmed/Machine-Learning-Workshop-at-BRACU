# Machine-Learning-Workshop-at-BRACU
Class 01:  After motivation and introduction, We will introduce python, python environments and a few famous libraries of python such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. kaggle and Kaggle platform and competitions on kaggle.

Class 02: Introduction to Regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest. How to implement those with python and evaluating the results finding differences among them.

Class 03: Introduction to Classification algorithms such as  KNN, SVM, Random Forest Classification. How to implement those with python and evaluating the results finding differences among them.

Class 04: Introduction to clustering & various recommender system algorithms such as  K- Means Clustering, PCA, Recommender System. How to implement those with python and apply those in real life problems & datasets.

Class 05: Introduction to Neural Networks. How to build a neural network from scratch & implement those for training different kinds of problems.

Class 06: There will be a Datathon competition where we will provide a dataset and participants will have to analyze that and find a suitable algorithm to get high accuracy.

Couldn't finish the workshop because of Covid-19 pandemic. :(
